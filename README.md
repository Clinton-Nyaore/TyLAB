Offline Speech and Audio to Text Desktop Application

I led a collaborative project that resulted in a Pyqt5-based desktop application utilizing the Vosk API for real-time offline speech and audio transcription to text. Our team's work began with an in-depth Vosk API documentation review, Python script development, rigorous testing for accuracy across various accents and languages, and seamless integration with a Pyqt5 interface. The application empowers users to transcribe audio from diverse sources with options to save or copy the text.
